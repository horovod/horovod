    A function that performs averaging or summation of the input tensor over
    all the Horovod processes. The input tensor is not modified.

    The reduction operation is keyed by the name. If name is not provided, an
    incremented auto-generated name is used. The tensor type and shape must be
    the same on all Horovod processes for a given name. The reduction will not

    This acts as a thin wrapper around an autograd function.  If your input
    tensor requires gradients, then callings this function will allow gradients
    to be computed and backpropagated.

    Arguments:
        tensor: A tensor to average and sum.
        average: A flag indicating whether to compute average or summation,
                 defaults to average.
