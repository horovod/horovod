"""## Communicating Between Processes with MPI

TensorFlow natively provides inter-device communication through send and
receive ops and inter-node communication through Distributed TensorFlow, based
on the same send and receive abstractions. On HPC clusters where Infiniband or
other high-speed node interconnects are available, these can end up being
insufficient for synchronous data-parallel training (without asynchronous
gradient descent). This module implements a variety of MPI ops which can take
advantage of hardware-specific MPI libraries for efficient communication.
