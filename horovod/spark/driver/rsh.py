    Method to run a command remotely given a host hash, local rank and driver addresses.

    This method connects to the SparkDriverService running on the Spark driver,
    retrieves all information required to connect to the task with given local rank
    of that host hash and invoke the command there.

    The method returns immediately after launching the command if background is True (default).
    When background is set to False, this method waits for command termination and returns
    command's result. If there is an exception while waiting for the result (i.e. connection reset)
    it returns -1.
