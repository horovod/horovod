Running Horovod
===============

The examples below are for Open MPI and use ``horovodrun``. Check your MPI documentation for arguments to the ``mpirun``
command on your system.

Typically one GPU will be allocated per process, so if a server has 4 GPUs, you would run 4 processes. In ``horovodrun``,
the number of processes is specified with the ``-np`` flag.

1. To run on a machine with 4 GPUs:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ horovodrun -np 4 -H localhost:4 python train.py

2. To run on 4 machines with 4 GPUs each:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ horovodrun -np 16 -H server1:4,server2:4,server3:4,server4:4 python train.py


Failures due to SSH issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The host where ``horovodrun`` is executed must be able to SSH to all other hosts without any prompts.

If ``horovodrun`` fails with permission error, verify that you can ssh to every other server without entering a password or
answering questions like this:


``The authenticity of host '<hostname> (<ip address>)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?``


To learn more about setting up passwordless authentication, see `this page <http://www.linuxproblem.org/art_9.html>`__.

To avoid ``The authenticity of host '<hostname> (<ip address>)' can't be established`` prompts, add all the hosts to
the ``~/.ssh/known_hosts`` file using ``ssh-keyscan``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ssh-keyscan -t rsa,dsa server1 server2 > ~/.ssh/known_hosts
